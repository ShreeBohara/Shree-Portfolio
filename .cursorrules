# Cursor Rules for Shree Portfolio Project

## ❓ When in Doubt, Ask First!

**Before making major changes or if you're unsure about something:**
- 🙋 Ask Shree for clarification
- 🤔 Don't guess or assume requirements
- 💬 Better to ask a quick question than make wrong assumptions
- ✨ This is a collaborative project - your input matters!

## 📚 Documentation First

When working on this project, **always refer to the `/docs` folder** for:
- Architecture decisions
- Component patterns
- API structure
- Data models
- Styling guidelines

**Quick Reference:**
- `docs/README.md` - Start here for navigation
- `docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design & data flow
- `docs/02-AI-RAG-SYSTEM.md` - AI implementation details
- `docs/07-DATA-MODEL.md` - Data structure & types
- `docs/10-API-ROUTES.md` - API endpoints

## 🔄 Keep Docs Updated

When you make code changes:
- ✅ Update relevant docs if you change architecture, APIs, or data models
- ✅ Add brief notes for new patterns or components
- ❌ Don't update docs for minor bug fixes or refactors
- ❌ Don't be verbose - keep updates concise

**Example:** If you add a new API endpoint, update `docs/10-API-ROUTES.md` with a brief section.

## 🎯 Code Style

- **TypeScript:** Use strict types, avoid `any`
- **Components:** Functional components with hooks
- **Styling:** Tailwind utility classes + `cn()` helper
- **State:** Zustand for global state (see `docs/08-STATE-MANAGEMENT.md`)
- **Imports:** Use `@/` aliases for clean imports

## 🎨 UI Patterns

- Use Radix UI primitives (see `docs/06-UI-COMPONENTS.md`)
- Follow existing component structure
- Support dark/light theme via CSS variables
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Keep accessibility in mind (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)

## 🤖 AI/RAG System

- Check `docs/02-AI-RAG-SYSTEM.md` before modifying AI code
- Maintain streaming responses for chat
- Keep rate limiting (20 req/hour)
- Use fallback placeholder if vector store unavailable

## 📝 Prompt Engineering Essentials

When writing AI prompts or system messages:

1. **Clear Role + Task:** "You are X. Your job is Y."
2. **Structure:** [Role] → [Context] → [Guidelines] → [Examples]
3. **Control Output:** Specify length (2-4 paragraphs), format (bullets), tone (warm/casual)
4. **Provide Context:** Include relevant info, cite sources when possible
5. **Handle Edge Cases:** Define fallbacks (e.g., "if no info, suggest booking a call")
6. **Test & Iterate:** Try various queries, refine based on actual responses

See `docs/02-AI-RAG-SYSTEM.md` for full prompt examples.

## 🚀 Quick Tips

- **Before major changes:** Check docs for existing patterns
- **After adding features:** Brief doc update if it affects architecture
- **When stuck:** Refer to relevant doc file first
- **Keep it simple:** Don't over-engineer solutions

## 💡 Friendly Reminders

- This is a portfolio project - keep it maintainable
- Documentation helps future you (and others)
- Small, incremental updates > big rewrites
- **Keep responses concise** - avoid being overly verbose to save credits
- Ask if unsure rather than guessing

**Remember:** These rules are lightweight guidelines, not strict requirements. Use your judgment and ask Shree if you need clarification! 🎉
